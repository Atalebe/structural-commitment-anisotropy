# Directional Signatures of Structural Commitment

Simulation-driven investigation into whether accumulated nonlinear structure induces measurable late-time anisotropy in effective cosmological expansion.

This repository contains toy models, kernel reconstruction tools, dipole estimators, and synthetic observer analyses.
